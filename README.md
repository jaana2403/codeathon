# Overview
This methodology provides a structured approach to developing a Flask-based backend application. It begins with setting up the project by integrating Flask, configuring CORS, and establishing MySQL as the primary database. Database initialization ensures that required tables are created and managed effectively. The authentication system is built using JWT tokens, with password hashing and user role validation to enhance security. Role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions within the system. CRUD operations allow efficient management of entities like organizations, business units, and subfunctions. Security measures such as token validation and input sanitization prevent unauthorized access. CORS is configured to support multiple frontend applications while enforcing security policies. Error handling and logging provide structured responses and help in debugging issues. Testing and debugging processes ensure API reliability, while deployment considerations focus on securing sensitive configurations, enabling HTTPS, and using a production-ready server setup.


# Task 1 and 2
### 1. *Project Setup*
- Utilize Flask as the backend framework.
- Enable CORS for cross-origin requests.
- Configure the secret key for JWT authentication.
- Establish MySQL as the primary relational database.
- Set up MongoDB and GridFS for file storage (if required).
- Import necessary libraries for security, authentication, and machine learning.

### 2. *Database Initialization*
- Configure MySQL connection settings.
- Establish a connection to the database and handle errors appropriately.
- Initialize required tables, including users and other entity-related tables.
- Close connections after operations to prevent leaks.

### 3. *Authentication System*
- Implement *JWT-based authentication* with token expiration.
- Use password hashing for security.
- Create token_required decorator to enforce authentication in protected routes.
- Develop user registration and login endpoints.
- Implement password reset functionality with JWT-based reset tokens.

### 4. *Role-Based Access Control*
- Define different user roles (Admin, Manager, Employee, CEO).
- Enforce role-based access control within the API endpoints.
- Validate user permissions before allowing data access/modifications.

### 5. *CRUD Operations for Entities*
- Implement endpoints for creating, managing, and deleting entities such as:
  - organization
  - org_group
  - business_unit
  - subfunction
  - faculties
- Validate input data before inserting into the database.
- Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

### 6. *Token-Based Security for API Requests*
- Extract JWT tokens from request headers.
- Decode and verify JWTs before processing requests.
- Enforce expiration and refresh mechanisms.

### 7. *CORS Configuration*
- Allow requests from frontend applications running on http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:3001, http://localhost:3002, and http://localhost:3003.
- Define allowed methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS).
- Allow necessary headers, including Authorization and Content-Type.

### 8. *Error Handling and Logging*
- Implement try-except blocks to catch and log database errors.
- Return structured JSON responses for errors and success messages.
- Log authentication failures and invalid token attempts.

### 9. *Testing and Debugging*
- Enable debugging mode for local development.
- Test endpoints using tools like *Postman* or *cURL*.
- Perform unit testing for database interactions and authentication.

### 10. *Deployment Considerations*
- Use environment variables for sensitive configurations (e.g., database credentials, JWT secret key).
- Deploy using a WSGI server such as *Gunicorn* for production.
- Implement HTTPS and secure headers for enhanced security.


# Task 3- Employee Performance and Impact Assessment

## Overview
This task generates a synthetic dataset of employee work metrics and uses an advanced predictive model to assess performance scores, burnout risks, and impact scales. The results are analyzed and saved into an Excel file, along with visualizations.

## Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates realistic employee data including working hours, overtime, sick leaves, projects completed, efficiency, and burnout risk.
- **Categorization**: Employees are categorized into different work levels.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses XGBoost to predict performance scores.
- **Data Export**: Saves the processed data and summary statistics to an Excel file.
- **Visualization**: Generates a scatter plot of working hours vs. performance scores.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy xgboost scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xlsxwriter
```

## How It Works
1. **Data Generation**: Creates a dataset of employees with computed efficiency and burnout risks.
2. **Employee Categorization**: Classifies employees based on working hours.
3. **Model Training & Prediction**: Uses XGBoost to predict performance scores.
4. **Data Export**: Saves results and summaries to an Excel file.
5. **Visualization**: Plots working hours against performance scores.

## Usage
Run the script to execute all processes automatically:
```sh
python impact ass.py
```

## Output
- **Employee_Impact_Assessment.xlsx**: Contains raw data and summary statistics.
- **Scatter Plot**: Visualizes working hours vs. performance scores.

## Author
This project was developed as part of an employee analytics initiative.
